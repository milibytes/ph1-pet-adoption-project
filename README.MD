Things to change from talking with Sekib:

Set the diplay of all 
Make a wrraper div -- Could add a class to a div that contains all pets, and then make that dissappear. THen all of the indivual pets will disappear


In CSS, can add a disabled status for the button
Change text to "cancel"
Add a button to the form that let's you cancel and go back to the list of animals

Could also have a "details" tag -- iit allows a drop down

If time, there are attributes that can suggest things that are saved to browsers -- "input tag attributes" - autocomplete will be the most relevant attribute
